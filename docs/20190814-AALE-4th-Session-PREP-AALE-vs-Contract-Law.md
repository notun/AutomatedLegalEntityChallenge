## Law ReImagined-
## Inventing Automated and Autonomous Legal Entities Part 4 
## (Preparation Stage)

### "AALE" Collaborative Hack with Dazza, Beth, Brenden, Bryan, Silke et al. 

### Preparing next AALE 4th Session-

#### Content largely derived from Dazza's CIVICS post dated August 8th 2019: 
#### “Creating a Legal Framework for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions” 
#### (https://civics.com/2019/08/08/creating-a-legal-framework-for-autonomous-agents-and-automated-transactions/)

#

#### And furthermore using the legal codification of the body of Contract Law provided by the 2nd Restatement:
#### (https://github.com/mitmedialab/AutomatedLegalEntityChallenge/blob/master/docs/20190812-Body-of-Contract-Law-2nd-Restatement.md), to carry out an AALE/DAOs relevant legal analysis. 
#### The aim is to surface a few more design requirements and legal engineering success metrics.

### Preparing next AALE 4th Session-
### CWP (Current Working Process) and method so far to tackle AALE vs Contract Law questions

#

#### Some things which have emerged on how we work individually & collectively:

a.	keep deliverables simple, effective, and usable for best impact.

b.	keep thought pattern narratives intelligible, digestible and palatable (and usable!).

c.	constantly check with mates to avoid re-inventing the wheel.

d.	tame early on the troïka of complexity, granularity & guaranteed rabbit holes.

e.	as old/new facts and thought patterns (re-)emerge, iterate, consolidate, integrate.

f.	regularly clarify what (evolving) objectives are, but also remind what they’re not.

g.	get language clearance, stay away from the State of Confusion (AAS vs AALE etc).

h.	remain ninjutsu-like agile & nimble- watch this perfect AALE 3rd Session Live from Berlin.

#

#### Acronyms:

AALE: Automated and Autonomous Legal Entity

AAS: Automated and Autonomous Systems

A/A: (various) Automated and Autonomous (stages)- or "autonomish" (see below referenced Joy Ito's video)

D/D: (various) Distributed and Decentralized (stages)

NPI: a human person (from NP Natural Person UK LAw and I Individual US Law)

#

#### In recent days - on top of recent weeks - some usable discussions & contents emerged …

#### … none of which happened in a vacuum- (e.g. Dazza’s 20+ years CIVICS service, etc.).

#### Key current working points & pathways may include:

1.	reminders of existing **ESIGN/UETA legal frameworks for electronic agents.**

2.	their relevance to **AAS Automated and Autonomous Systems that are transacting**.

3.	and their relevance at least as model to tackle Contract Law AALE implications, so as to ...

4.	... surface a few more **AALE design requirements & legal engineering success metrics.**

5.	key-takeaway in AAS context: **need clear _attribution_ to a responsible legal person...**

6.	... to avoid **accountability gap for the potential harm & damage** such AAS could cause.

7.	consider appropriate, usable and effective measures for **_attribution_ in AAS context.**

8.	such attribution measures to focus on **acts and/or consequences of acts of AAS ...**

9. ... by **linking ownership, control & accountability _back to responsible parties._**

10.	clearly visible **license plates** required for vehicles suggest **analogous AAS pathways.**

11.	these AAS pathways operate _mano a mano_ with **AALE designed to sustain and manage them.**

12.	discern for AAS & AALE **various stages of A/A and D/D that impact _attribution._**

These are only a few suggested tracks to support our further individual & collective efforts & CWP.

Key references this time include:

-	Dazza’s post on CIVICS site dated August 8th 2019:

>“Creating a Legal Framework for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions” 
(https://civics.com/2019/08/08/creating-a-legal-framework-for-autonomous-agents-and-automated-transactions/),

-	Recent exchanges Dazza – Bryan – Brenden et al. In Bryan’s words:

>Both (ESIGN/UETA), even just as possible models, have some language that is helpful to understanding Contract Law for automated entities, specifically with regards to _**intent to form a contract, acceptance, and purported alteration of a contract with an automated entity.**_


-	A must-read GiHub post by Brenden dated May 2019:
>"AALE Frameworks - Industry Classifications on Autonomous Systems": (https://github.com/mitmedialab/AutomatedLegalEntityChallenge/pull/1/commits/fc6863e0690ea2e0a03adcc2dd000451bbdd9105)

That GitHub post by Brenden starts to cover the issue of discerning various stages of A/A & D/D for AALEs. 

It also includes a pretty foundational Joi Ito video on Autonomous (autonomish...) Systems, worth watching to get a grasp of how to possibly tackle various stages of A/A & D/D for AAS (implicitly AALE): https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yWdKySVcqVo  

#### Re-visiting above Brenden GitHub post is worth it imho, in a way that is relevant to our specific angle here: 

o	to surface a few more **design requirements and legal engineering success metrics for AALE.**

o	focusing at this particular moment in time on the mutual relevance with **Restatement (2nd) of Contract Law**
(https://github.com/mitmedialab/AutomatedLegalEntityChallenge/blob/master/docs/20190812-Body-of-Contract-Law-2nd-Restatement.md)

The thing here & now isn't to establish a taxonomy of various A/A & D/D stages per se (though that alone sounds like a worthy purpose) but more to kind of get a feel of how we should break the complexity into smaller bits & prioritize them, e.g. maybe:

-	a **core chunk to focus the bulk of our design efforts**, whereas, for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions, we kind of operate over the **robust foundation of the ESIGN/ UETA frameworks for electronics agents**, and for which a **clear attribution to a responsible legal person is straightforward.**

-	And then other chunks where such assumptions are less straightforward. 

In which case, for these less straightforward other chunks, we might opt for a brief characterization, and perhaps live them out, at least temporarily, as “capped guaranteed rabbit holes”. About which we reserve the right to re-engage these at a later date, should they "capped guaranteed rabbit holes" remain linked to many really current and pressing practical & legal questions. And if such is really the case, then it is to be ascertained first how current and pressing.

-	For the **core chunk** we may focus on how acts and/or consequences of acts of AAS, pan out for **AALE functions & legal objects**, by **linking ownership, control & accountability back to responsible parties that are legal persons and/or NPI.** 

-	Some initial book case scenario(s) and/or some of the Publishing DAO scenario(s) might be worth re-visiting. _Creating (a) new scenario(s) doesn’t seem necessary at this stage, unless …_

-	... unless we would need to map out scenarios to e.g. **emphasize relevance of clearly visible license plates required for vehicles, to suggest AALE engineering pathways that are articulated with AAS solutions pathways analogous to license plates.**

-	for example we could introduce **a transacting-drone (fetch-pay-deliver)** or introduce **a new AAS in the scenario, that does problematic things-** either deliberately programmed to steal by its owner, or it gets hacked, and book and/or money are gone, then **who is responsible and liable for what:** remember the book scenarios matrix hypothesis **“AALE/DAO gone rogue”**, but here now the right question becomes **how does a “clean” AALE deals with an ecosystem internal AAS gone rogue?**


It might also be useful to consider an AAS that does problematic things, like a transacting-drone (fetch-pay-deliver) gone rogue, in order to kind of **clarify three questions:**

-	On a very simple and concrete example, what should **AALE engineering pathways** be (roughly), for AALE to operate _mano a mano_ with these AAS but also deal with them when they go wrong- for whatever reason.

-	What are (roughly) for AAS the **various stages of A/A and D/D that would _impact attribution_**, and how should AALE be engineered to deal with that.

-	Where are (roughly) the legal domain borderlines, within which we may **safely assume that we can execute legal analysis of scenarios for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions, under the model of AAS being mere electronic agents as being dealt with by the ESIGN/UETA frameworks, with a clear attribution mechanism ...**

- ... whereas there must be a place where we should (roughly) put the legal domain borderlines (think “yet another **capped rabbit hole**” ninja technique à la Beth) for **these stages of A/A & D/D that warrant ambiguity and/or impossibility of a straightforward attribution mechanism and therefore a potential problem of accountability gap and/or legal vacuum** (unless we consider that problem doesn’t really exist _**yet**_, then okay let's drop that angle but reasonably anticipate that problem may eventually pop up) ...

- ... whereas there must be a place where we should (roughly) put the legal domains borderlines where we think **the model of AAS being mere electronic agents, as being dealt with by the ESIGN/UETA frameworks, and being managed by AALE as such, _doesn’t apply anymore..._** 

- ... and instead, there might be ground for **bestowing directly the AAS with the capacities and status of Legal Agent**, or at least provide arguments in favor of the Legal System(s) evolving in that direction. 

- In which latest case, what would be the (rough) features to **outfit the AALE with functions to enable the AALE to handle these Legal-Agent-Status capable AAS.** _Because this sounds clearly like a guaranteed rabbit hole, it should be capped._

- However the recent case of the **Inventor-AI kind of AAS** has demonstrated that we might be only several years to a couple of decades away from dealing with the issue of _**substantially autonomISH systems that qualify as Legal Agents**_, rather than half-a-century as it is currently assumed by some regulatory senior decision makers occasionally quoted in the Financial Times. _Our work, while remaining within proper boundaries, might want to at least underline this awareness and foresight_ even if we choose to so far deal with it as a "capped guaranteed rabbit hole".

#### Next steps of our CWP

Regardless of none-partial-full validation of all of the above, what we (non-Lawyer Chris) are doing right now - besides scrambling to complete the migration of relevant previous content to GitHub – is, based on a current process which we reserve the right to modify:

- define a **core chunk to focus the bulk of our design efforts**, whereas, for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions, we kind of operate over the **robust foundation of the ESIGN/ UETA frameworks for electronics agents**, and for which a **clear attribution to a responsible legal person is straightforward.**

-	keep above **core chunk focus** while not getting too hang up with the guaranteed rabbit holes (capped or uncapped at will).

-	then, scanning through the **Restatement (2nd) of Contract Law** (https://github.com/CryptosOdysseus/AALE-Contributions/blob/master/20190812-Body-of-Contract-Law-2nd-Restatement.md), look for these sections, articles and underlying legal concepts, **that logically resonate & articulate with issues relevant to above core chunk focus framework,** and write some comments- but doing this first _in abstracto_, not yet getting entangled in any specific scenario. 

-	then, from that, like we did for Agency Law, we hope to **derive a check-list of some of Restatement (2nd) of Contract Law's most relevant articles and concepts in usability & applicability to above core chunk focus, _then,_ do scenarios.** 

-	at that time we should be able to apply that check-list together with the **R4 (Roles and Relationships, Rights and Responsibilities) & other relevant functions**, to allocate roles to functions and then play some of the scenarios from the perspective of each role, within an AALE/DAO context. 

-	during that process, it would be then expected that we would be further able to extract from the check-list a couple of **pivotal axis**, that would help to further narrow focus toward a short-list, a limited set of at least **a few more AALE design requirements & legal engineering success metrics.**

We’ll see how it goes. 

But remember: **"You're not stuck in traffic- You _are_ traffic."**

#### Remarks:

#### Regardless of above method brief, we encourage you to read Dazza’s August 8th CIVICS post if you haven’t done it yet:
#### “Creating a Legal Framework for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions”
#### (https://civics.com/2019/08/08/creating-a-legal-framework-for-autonomous-agents-and-automated-transactions/). 

Here are some of the **most salient points** within the full takeaway:

**The most important concept to take away from these legal frameworks in the context of automated and autonomous systems is the need for attribution to a legal person.**

**Automated and autonomous systems that are designed and deployed in ways that ensure clear attribution to responsible legal persons help avoid an accountability gap for potential harm and damage these systems could cause.**

**Vehicles are required to have clearly visible license plates when they enter upon public roads and may impact other people. These license plates provide a simple, effective way to start linking ownership, control and accountability for vehicles back to responsible parties.**

**Analogously, it is wise to consider appropriate, usable and effective measures for attribution of the acts or consequences of automated and autonomous systems.**

#### More on the content and full takeaway quoting directly from above mentioned Dazza’s CIVICS post 
#### “Creating a Legal Framework for Autonomous Agents and Automated Transactions” 
#### (https://civics.com/2019/08/08/creating-a-legal-framework-for-autonomous-agents-and-automated-transactions/):

Some of the most pressing legal questions are hardly new at all, and in fact legal frameworks in US federal and state law have already been enacted to address those questions. 

In the context of electronic contracts and automated transactions the two key laws of this type are:

-	the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) at the state level (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act )

and

- the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) at the federal level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act)


One of the most relevant parts of these laws relates directly to the use of new technologies like blockchain and AI that enable a high degree of automation and in some cases, even autonomous action.

Specifically, these laws define the rules for enforceability of contracts formed without human review or approval through use of “electronic agents” conducting “automated transactions”. 

According to the federal ESIGN Act:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act

>A contract or other record relating to a transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because its formation, creation, or delivery involved the action of one or more electronic agents so long as the action of any such electronic agent is legally attributable to the person to be bound.

>…and…

>The term “electronic agent” means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part without review or action by an individual at the time of the action or response.

>https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-106publ229/html/PLAW-106publ229.htm

Similarly, according to the state Uniform Electronic Transactions Act:

>In an automated transaction, the following rules apply:

>(1) A contract may be formed by the interaction of electronic agents of the parties, even if no individual was aware of or reviewed the electronic agents’ actions or the resulting terms and agreements.

>(2) A contract may be formed by the interaction of an electronic agent and an individual, acting on the individual’s own behalf or for another person, including by an interaction in which the individual performs actions that the individual is free to refuse to perform and which the individual knows or has reason to know will cause the electronic agent to complete the transaction or performance.

>(3) The terms of the contract are determined by the substantive law applicable to it.

>…and…

>“Electronic agent” means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part, without review or action by an individual.

>https://www.uniformlaws.org/viewdocument/final-act-no-comments-27?CommunityKey=2c04b76c-2b7d-4399-977e-d5876ba7e034&tab=librarydocuments

**The most important concept to take away from these legal frameworks in the context of automated and autonomous systems is the need for attribution to a legal person.**

The federal ESIGN Act states plainly that the contracts or other acts of electronic agents (eg automated processes or systems) **can not be denied legal force or effect “so long as the action of any such electronic agent is legally attributable to the person to be bound.”**

**UETA provides some further guidance on the rules related to _attribution:_**

>An electronic record or electronic signature is attributable to a person if it was the act of the person. The act of the person may be shown in any manner, including a showing of the efficacy of any security procedure applied to determine the person to which the electronic record or electronic signature was attributable.

>The effect of an electronic record or electronic signature attributed to a person under subsection (a) is determined from the context and surrounding circumstances at the time of its creation, execution, or adoption, including the parties’ agreement, if any, and otherwise as provided by law.

UETA, SECTION 9. ATTRIBUTION AND EFFECT OF ELECTRONIC RECORD AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE.

**Automated and autonomous systems that are designed and deployed in ways that ensure clear attribution to responsible legal persons help _avoid an accountability gap for potential harm and damage these systems could cause._** 

Vehicles are required to have **clearly visible license plates** when they enter upon public roads and may impact other people. These license plats provide a simple, effective way to start **linking ownership, control and accountability for vehicles back to responsible parties.**

Analogously, it is wise to consider **appropriate, usable and effective measures for attribution of the acts or consequences of automated and autonomous systems.**

I (Dazza) feel some responsibility to provide a few links and a high level overview of these laws because of the time I spent assisting with their drafting and enactment. 

I (Dazza) attended every drafting meeting but one for UETA over multiple years and worked actively with the US House and Senate on drafting the ESIGN Act. 

My (Dazza) testimony before the US House advocating for the Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN) at a hearing June 9, 1999 of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection provides some more context. 

I (Dazza) am grateful for the recognition of my contributions read into the Congressional Record by then Senator Abraham, who stated:

>“I would also like to give thanks to Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci for his assistance and support through the process of drafting this legislation. Massachusetts should be proud of the work done by their Governor and his staff on this bill, especially the Governor’s Special Counsel for e-commerce, Daniel Greenwood, to assure that state and federal law governing e- >commerce are complimentary.”
