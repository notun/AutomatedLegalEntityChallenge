**_“ As a process for ensuring that each working session has something produced from it - insights, concerns identified - it would be good to:_**

**- 1) include a summary of the goals in the call that is laid out ahead of time,**

**- 2) materials involved to produce the session, and**

**- 3) a feedback loop that takes in the information from the call and generates a summary from it.**

Initial steps toward implementing above 3-points steps, for post-facto adjustments, _as we are in the process of migrating all take-outs from 3 Live sessions till now, plus relevant Telegram channels dynamic content, to this GitHub repository:_
 
**-1- Turns out this Publishing DAO Live session** didn’t put that much emphasis on digital/crypto & on-chain/token action side of things (though off-record preparatory calls did, see below Part G), but on a larger priority at this stage: the main goal of the exercise was to explore scenarios (use cases) when something goes wrong mostly “off-chain”. And then see what difference that would or would not make, when it happens to a Publishing DAO, compared with the same thing happening in a more traditional setting, like full paper paradigm with very little tech construct. We still have steps to sort out “off-chain” events, starting with “deep” Contract Law analysis, then we might want to dive even deeper on how that interferes with on-chain action. Beth hammered that point head-on (see F-3 Merits of Contract Law framework) toward the end of the Session: _**“in the DAO diagram, each of the circles is human behavior that exists to a certain extent off-chain, whereas each of the square parts is an autonomous software going forward and the fact that each of these different functions it is involved in initiating or impacting a transaction and some of them like onboarding might come in its certain points and end up impacting other points.”**_ For Beth introduction & methodology scroll down to full transcript and/or check this segment starting at https://youtu.be/-WhLz2AqmxY?t=58 right after Dazza's preamble and presentations.

#### -B- Engagement with customer and laying the ground to establish a lawyer-client relationship
 
_**While none of this is Legal Advice, nor may be construed as (an attempt at) Legal Practice, the ones in a position to expect from this some form of usefulness & utility include our friends at Publishing DAO, so we try & make it worth their while first, so it might work for us as well.**_
 
And while we’re all thriving to build a robust AALE/DAO-based economy, that is scalable, taxable, affordable to, and manageable by, the largest possible chunk of the population, we also need to deal with the other side of the coin: the fact that DAOs may increasingly be targeted by law suits, or find themselves being harmed in ways that they want to be in a position to sue. The scenarios developed here show exactly what could happen in rather realist settings, and preliminary measures that Publishing DAO leaders might want to take to arm & shield themselves.
 
Which means that when they go & talk to a lawyer, DAO leaders are equipped with fundamentals to get their stuff properly & gradually in order.
 
Publishing DAO leaders (Cem & Jim) spent many months building up a DAO structure that is resilient and can be tweaked to perform a large variety of actions in diverse settings, in addition to a number of financing mechanisms- that when deployed, generate complexity & granularity.
 
Thus, a first step is to freeze a limited set of rather simple scenarios, since you don’t want to take into account all DAO potentialities, not at the same time. As demonstrated with the previous book scenarios, taking such a simple business case, there’s already so much complexity generated (through the prism of Agency Law alone!) that you don’t even want to start from a multifaceted context, because you’d get lost at the onset.
 
Having done that can feel a bit restraining for an entrepreneur & DAO leader, because you naturally want to go in with all options. Then the next most important step and not necessarily a trivial one either, is to get the DAO leaders to step back from their daily Business variety & Technical structure mindset, and move instead into a Legal analysis mindset, in terms of tackling roles & relationship, then rights & responsibilities (R4).
 
This isn’t trivial: for ex. you thought your DAO was “in charge” of a set-up then find out DAO isn’t a Principal but an Agent instead, that could be perplexing for a moment. Or Principal-Agent R4 are not defined, then look at another Legal Analysis framework, Contract Law (and Tort).
 
So, there is this little dance & it can be wobbling for a while, until clarity & empathy do the job, paving the way for a lawyer-client relationship.

#
 
#### -C- Start with simplified use cases and build a primary foundation – then build up complexity
 
_**Emphasis: for the purpose of Legal Analysis, you can't ever really know a legal outcome unless you apply the lots of facts so we have to at least lock down some example for the analysis (Dazza), and for that we need to freeze scenarios with a finite set of things that are possible & happen.**_
 
Last time we choose to engage with a physical book being shared between parties, then going into a DAO use case, that was already complex. This time we continue to apply the Agency Law framework to a variety of scenarios that revolve around a Publishing DAO- for examining power differential in relationships, duties of care & fiduciary, in various situations where you want to first define R4 (Roles & Relationships, Rights & Responsibilities). And then we want to extrapolate these ideas to creating frameworks for DAOs.
 
Technically in the DAO chart, entities are marked in a circle whereas autonomous processes are marked in a square. That leads to thought patterns narrative and various permutations, to which a permutation matrix (Chris) may be applied to analyze legal outcomes (as summed up by Dazza, what the matrix does, is to allocate functions to roles, then play out scenarios from the perspective of each role). Ultimately this may lead to another DAO architecture whereas the DAO performs a specific function for external parties & for itself (Beth).
 
Just starting with these Law school patterns, you go through permutations and see certain processes, so you start to understand more of the nuances and really break down and understand what the different rules are here (Bryan). And so you can actually see how complex the situation can get because the rules are becoming very granular and complicated rather quickly (Cem).

The segment where Cem mentions complexity and Bryan explain the methodology is back at the beginning at minute 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=300

#

#
 
#### -D- Taming the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes
 
A basic definition of the role of leadership is to slice complexity into smaller bits and prioritize these. A next step then is to box-in granularity (like in a matrix) so as to guide people through the process of building frameworks from the ground up. Because guaranteed rabbit holes are there to stay, you need to cap them until you can deal with them in “cruise control” mode.

Then, these frameworks need to be built in ways that keep scenarios and thought patterns narratives relevant to business context, technical constraints, and legal defense (and attack) objectives, and make these digestible, intelligible, palatable & useful for the purpose of AALE/DAOs (and to be very clear, in these Publishing DAO scenarios this time, we left off the fund allocation part to keep it simple (Beth)).

To prioritize isn’t to deny nor ignore nor under-estimate the consequential manifestations of such complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes. It is merely a principle of the business of life that things are meant to be tackled “by the right people, at the right time, in the right place”.

#### -E- (Re-)Statement of objectives

##

##### E-1: Pre-Fall objectives (Working Topics as laid out by Dazza in GitHub & HackMD):

_**Quote: “Starting with the basic agency law analysis conducted during our prior session focused on the roles, relationships, rights and responsibilities of the Principal, Agent and Third Party in the three scenarios involving the sale of a book, as a next step we ask:**_

**• What are the issues, options and opportunities presented when one of the Actors in each scenario is itself a DAO or other type of automated and autonomous legal entity?**

**• Specifically, what issues, options and opportunities arise with respect to the legal concepts:**

-o Binding Assent to Agency Relationship and Contract Formation (lots of open questions)
-o Scope and Type of Authority (addressed above and more questions identified)
-o Estoppel and Detrimental reliance (addressed above and more questions identified)

_**How can an automated system be constructed such that at any given point in time the relevant roles / relationships and rights / responsibilities, and hence most probably legal outcomes, can be assessed at any moment in the transaction or workflow etc.**_

**Note: a very well B/L/T/ engineered system should afford this type of monitoring and reporting "out-of-the-box". “ Unquote.

##### F-1: Apply several Legal Frameworks & define R4 (Roles & Relationships, Rights & Responsibilities)

So we apply various Legal analysis Frameworks: in previous & current cycle we stuck to Agency Law, and we’ll soon be transitioning to a deep Contract Law analysis with some Tort Law as well maybe. On the way we cross path with issues related to IP protection, national security & state secrets, freedom of press & information, that have different Laws across jurisdiction (like Germany isn’t like US, etc.), so we know these guaranteed rabbit holes are there for the digging, anytime.
 
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, because for legal analysis (Dazza) you can't ever really know a legal outcome unless you apply the lots of facts, we have to at least lock down some example for the analysis- and freeze scenarios with a finite set of possibilities that happen. First things first, you want to sort out R4, i.e. identified how many relevant parties there are and who they are, then define what their respective Roles & Relationships are, to start with. Then you want to define what each of them Rights & Responsibilities are.
 
So if you look at the publishing DAO workflow diagram (Beth, Bryan) we have all of the different roles identified with the circles and then we have all the automated processes indicated with the rectangles. Thus, you’re able to visually see the flow between parties and how this kind of transaction was taking place over these different scenarios permutations. But there is a difference between technical roles and legal roles: in that sense, while business/tech-wise, the DAO is “in charge”, legally it’s more like Bob is the Principal & the DAO is the Agent. Why is that so?
 
Well the key thing in Agency Law (Dazza) is that the Principal and the Agent agree with each other that the Agent will do something on the Principal's behalf as basically this is like the Agent is the servant of the Principal for this task (on that point click on segment starting at minute 26 with Brenden's statement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=1560 ). So even if that's a little bit of a stretch for the intended scenarios, we’re glad that we're able to suspend disbelief that this is usually probably not how it would go with the DAO- but at least doing so we can run on training wheels first and then build the complexity up. And complexity is definitely up (Beth) because it can get really crazy so quickly that it's it would be hard to have a structured discussion where you went through each of the things- way to deal with it.  
 
There's a major distinction (Beth) that we just tried to do the simplest version of it, which is somebody can join the DAO themselves and publish from within the DAO: but that is one of the factors that would change it because then the DAO become a principal, because somebody would come with them, the DAO would be doing it. So in order to keep the agent as a third party that is getting published through them, Bob does not join the DAO, he stays as a member of the public, he doesn't become an author that exists within the DAO, he’s not in “DAO authors box” at all.
 
And so the question that you can ask at the end of scenarios permutations A, B, C is what would what are the rights and responsibilities of the party when the thing blows up so it represents the fact that when the thing blew up (Dazza). In B,  you get a cease and desist letter from the National Security Agency or the equivalent agency of your country where most of the people are, where Bob is or where the machine is that's polluting or whatever, and okay now what happens make it clear that in this country under this law they have a fine and they assess a fine of a million dollars for this violation, and now people are wondering like okay I wanna, now we get into sort of like almost a quasi-litigation or a mediation context, and people are trying to throw the hot potato to the other party, saying what I don't want to pay it should be the expresso machine or I don’t want to pay that should be someone else, uses of each party in terms of ultimate liability for this massive screw-up.
 
Then the next question would be (Dazza - segment starting at minute 29 & 30 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=1770 ) if in order to have a circle from a legal perspective unlike a technical diagram like in this case the circle represents a party (and a party is a legal entity that can sue and be sued like that's the whole point of it) so according to all over good enough analysis, if there's nothing else that's happened such as creating an LLC or some other legal form that would hold up, then the default analysis is you have a general partnership so every member of that circle would be jointly and severally liable for the actions that happened. So they're the ones that own the espresso machine and just to go with what Cem was saying that's the jurisdiction where the heats coming down from the Security Agency and they just assess the fine then, what we mean, not being a litigator but one would imagine that people would start wondering is there anybody that's a member of this DAO who has like locus or nexus with that jurisdiction, like do they have a house there do they look there can we get our hands on them and you can start basically subpoenaing those people. Because they're all jointly and severally liable are there any other assets at all, but then to kick it up a notch, so if you imagine that it has legal personality which is kind of the idea of the legal entity part of the AALE, then you ask the question well what legal personality does it have: is it a corporation, an LLC, a nonprofit of some other form and then you could ask why do you think it is this legal entity, like is there a jurisdiction that's granted it, or is there some other reason why a court would ascribe legal entity-ness to it, so how about those questions.

##### F-2: Merits of Agency Law framework
 
Merits are based on applications of the Agency Law framework to concepts, in given contexts, that highlight fact patterns & legal outcomes. In scenario B, we can also impact the knowledge (Beth) because it's like none of the curators realized that this is included, maybe is it something where they would have more duty of care in their country’s context (how should a European person be legally compelled to not spill US state secrets). In scenario C we're trying (Beth) to get out this idea that if there's a legal information somehow in a book but the people who are approving the existence of this book don't realize it's illegal or in general that's like the DAO is publishing this illegal thing- the only DAO “No” vote did come from a curator who noticed that the poems were very similar to Ginsberg and looked up the original poem to confirm it but didn't share that information with the other voters. So to compare between permutation B and C then in both scenarios there was some illegal aspect, the proposal passed regardless that all the curators who voted yes to pass the approval were ignorant to the fact that they were illegal.
 
So it seems in essence it's sort of the same thing where there's something illegal or liability attracting about the content of the book (Dazza - segment starting at minute 41 & 20 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=2480 ) but in the C case it's IP and not violation of some state secret as in B. So the reason why Agency Law is so interesting as opposed to Contract Law, Tort or something for looking these relationships, is when you've got an Agent that's operating on behalf of a Principal, and that's like a valid relationship. The US Law standard says the principal is held to know everything that the agent knows. And so there's like a constructive knowledge, so if the Agent are aware of something, the Principal is held to be aware of that thing too, so the Agents acting like as the Principal, which means that the Agent damn well better tell the Principal things that they become aware of (like the property you're buying is on toxic waste or whatever). They know the principle is held to know that, so if in this case the Agent is the Publishing is the DAO, and the Principal is Bob, and for whatever reason Bob is unaware that his stuff violates IP, but the last one of the people at the edge, one of the agents is aware, it may rep as a question of whether they've dragged Bob down. Because of the specific facts it seems quite likely that since Bob was the originator of the material that Bob threw out (I guess in the ordinary course I'd assume Bob would be well aware of what Bob did) though the question then becomes can you attribute the knowledge of this one agent to the other agents somehow, like did they become tainted with the knowledge that there was a violation somehow without IP. It's really complicated but there're other issues with contributory like violation of IP where you know just the mere fact that you're doing it even without knowledge, you can create some liability, and like there's a whole tangled web of IP law that we need to not get into in order to just look at the general liability, applying permutations at high level.
 
One question in C is, the curators didn't know that they were contributing like the curators who voted to pass it at all didn't realize that they were doing that and the one person that didn't realize this like wasn't involved in like pushing it like the actual transaction itself kind of pushed the causal chain forward. The fact pattern is like the extent to which the corporate veil like it happens with DAOs, and like in particular whether the different people and the DAO are all considered on equal footing as entities within the DAO or if only voting members are. Since going back to the diagram where you know there's autonomous processes and then there's the human in the loop that happens if so it's basically like the process is only pushed forward by the actions they're capable or voting and so if the action that happens such that the book is actually published is only pushed forward by individuals that didn't realize that they were doing something wrong, then does the opinion or the level of knowledge of someone who didn't know they were doing something wrong like this, does that have any impact like liability piercing.
 
And one question in D is one would think the logistics partner would have a duty to deliver correctly, like this book that was ordered through them, so does that mean that because the DAO contracts with the logistics partner to perform this function, then because the performance of the function fell apart on the logistics partner side, then is the DAO still liable for the fact that they were supposed to deliver on that time, even though it wasn't the actions within the DAO but instead a contractor of the DAO whom might have messed up.
(+ one remark by Jim relevant to ADR interfacing & whether the Principal & logistics Agent signed a contract that stipulates that it's applicable in a certain jurisdiction is it referring to a decentralized arbitration scheme possibly involving an escrow, then again depends on jurisdiction).  
 
A clear demonstration of why it matters to allocate roles to parties at the onset: if you if you sort of say (Dazza - segment starting at 1hr 07 minutes & 39 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=4059 ), fuzz some of that detail and try to apply an agency law analysis, if you said the Principal was the DAO and the Agent was the logistics company that messed up, and the Third Party was whomever, the funny thing is the Third Party you could say was the reading public, or you'd have to think about who the Third Party was, but they have to be someone that was waiting for the book and who is harmed by the fact that it wasn't there, so the bookstores or the adoring fans or whatever. Then probably like in the highest level of drive you can attribute the path of the Agent to the Principal and so if the DAO thought it was such a great idea to choose this logistics company, that was their choice: they were in the best position to avoid the loss and there can be held responsible under Agency Law from the acts of the Agent. In fact that's the whole point of agency law is to draw a direct connection between the principal and the agent and to drop in to figure out the lines that they're offering with them. And then if you think about defenses you can wonder was there's some supervening kind of cause outside of a contract term, or maybe was doing something but you didn't say this in the facts, but like if the agent was way out of the scope of its authority and there's no point an ordinary reasonable third party would have known that then they break the liability chain, but for the most part the basic analysis is the Principal would be held responsible for the negligence of the logistics Agent in not providing the service.
 
Scenario D begs the question of the DAO’s ability to sue the logistics company (Silke). And just to play it through even more realistically (Dazza) so that we have all these connected, you've got a third party that's aggrieved in this case so like we were depending on the book but our birthday party didn't work because we didn't have the books or we lost some money in our business, they sue the principal the DAO let's say for not giving them the book and then the DAO does a cross-claim or counterclaim to their agent who was the publishing company to say hey it was your fault so we just got sued for ten million dollars you owe me ten million dollars to pay off the suit, because you're the one that messed up. And so we think that's how the chain goes but to really complete these things in the scenario you have to be a little more explicit about what went wrong, who was harmed, and who can they lay their hands on basically. In D, Charlie got harmed (Beth, even though his book is terrible so maybe everyone else was better off that it didn't get distributed, but the intern at logistics company Charlie Corp. probably made a terrible error (calendar app mishap), which is a derivative situation in every way.

##### F-3: Merits of Contract Law framework (+ some Tort Law maybe)
 
Looking at permutation E, so it's Bob problem that parties didn't enter into the agreement (Beth) and it's a failure point that doesn't have legal implication unless it's built into the contract so we've wanted to include this one because that's where contract law intersects with agency law and things need to be corrected in the situation. So if under Agency Law one may argue that Bob is the Principal and the DAO is the Agent, in fact the Principal-Agent relationship has not been formed (Jim). This means we can’t do an Agency Law analysis if there's not one of those, but why don't we, well how about just a Contract Law analysis.
 
The fact that the Principal-Agent relationship hasn’t been formed starts from the fact that the DAO did not vote on such proposal (Jim). It just means that they don't enter into an agreement in the first place. Let's say that, since the attention is limited, there can be 100,000 proposals, and just because they made the proposals to the DAO without the DAO being the Agent for those (would-be) Principals. So the party that made the proposal only become the principal if and when the DAO approves the proposal and approves entering into an Agency relationship. The question is whether there is any basis for the DAO to have some sort of liability in executing the Principal proposal. Hard to see any basis for liability at all unless they've out-promised that the DAO would decide by a certain time or something, or like if they breach some promise or duty (Dazza).
 
And so with that in mind what would happen if we were constructing this DAO in real life, what would be some important factors to make sure we consider so that we don't run into that problem (Beth). To be sure, one thing to make it clear to everybody before they submit a proposal, that we DAO may say yes or no or take no action on your proposal, and we bear no liability. And then you might as a DAO want to make a click-through sometimes that the people that submit a proposal agree contractually to your terms, and then one of the terms honestly should be “we are not your agent for purposes of business, that absolutely eliminates an Agency Law analysis” (Dazza).(Cem, get a lawyer & get it done!).
 
When contract Law complements Agency Law- Brenden: to go back to Dazza’s circular point if the publisher - principal had a clause that said I I'm not going to be liable for your unhappy child at his birthday party then there wouldn't be an issue? Indeed, if you can get  a direct mention of the liability - as the parties sometimes do it - and in the contract clauses, once we finish this Agency Law stuff, we should probably spend some deep time on Contract Law where most of the action is. But there's a way to then wheedle around disclaimers and things like that are a very important and interesting analysis and it kind of gets the DAO stuff to the place where it needs to get to. Which is thinking through like what should be the standard clauses, and who are the people that should be agreeing what, and when, in the whole lifecycle of the transactions.  What kind of disclaimers can you put in there, what other liability what kind of damages taps and what is the chain of contractual privity basically that makes sense for the innovation and the new relationships made possible by the DAO (Dazza).
 
 
In permutation F, Bob has to choose between just not getting the book printed at all but unlike before where it was the fault of the logistics partner not printing it in time now it's his fault because he was on-boarded to know that he had to do all of these steps in order to actually get it printed. So this comes into a point and also probably just highlights the fact that it's impossible to really get into an analysis of this without Contract Law, because it's like he tries to say that because he wasn't all warned enough, then they should cover the cost, so try to get at this question of who covers the cost for these different things that makes sense. Asking: this might also be a question of General Terms (Silke) and a question like, was an agency relationship worked at all- is it like the other case E, that earlier fact pattern where there wasn't actually any agency relationship (Beth)- asking. For Dazza, it seems more like a Tort (Law) kind of Contract (Law) thing the way that it was done.    
 
And maybe, there's some other examples of how onboarding could go wrong as well (Beth), so that's probably not even a good permutation maybe, but the thing just before we quickly close up this, it's open to any questions that anyone has about this. Then we think what we really wanted to highlight there is, how, as we mentioned at the beginning, each of the circles is human behavior that exists to a certain extent off-chain, whereas each of the square parts is an autonomous software going forward, and that is like the bonding curve that maybe we can talk just briefly mentioned for a few minutes oh it's not like the spot box but like the fact that each of these different functions it is involved in initiating or impacting a transaction and some of them like onboarding might come in its certain points and end up impacting other points.

##

So a key question now is the dichotomy of traditional ecosystem analysis vs AALE/DAO ecosystem analysis, in relation with the 4 most likely Legal Structures to be concerned in a US (Common) Law context (that may be easily tweaked for EU and other jurisdictions). Then (Bryan - segment starting at minute 29 & 30 seconds with Dazza's statement followed by Bryan's lines https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=1770 ) if you start drilling down on the type of entity & issues involved, specific outcomes that are correlated with an Agency Law outcome scenario tracker, then you can start plugging in some of the DAO/scenarios permutations matrix/table, and start building a framework: what happens if this takes place as a General Partnership, or should be seen under the lends of an LLC, or a BB LLC, or an Inc. corporation. And related to that dichotomy, if it’s an AALE/DAO that’s involved, together with its ecosystem and its very polyvalent way of functioning, then we can start comparing and contrasting and understanding what those patterns are between actors and outcomes, such as: what happens if it's an AALE/DAO ; what happens if it's like a human or a set of humans- just doing this without any kind of technological assistance, a kind of paper paradigm, etc. By walking through the Agency Law transaction table, identifying what happens when things go wrong, and identifying what those roles and responsibilities are, we can then start going through the agency outcomes sheet and populating it with the relevant information that we extract.

##### F-5: "Three-Bees" Functions & Legal Objects that are required to build up frameworks toward objectives

>• **“ if business type is A, if roles are configured X, the function involved is Y, then outcome is Z “**

Brenden rebounding on Silke’s thoughts of engineering much by contract:

**“At some point we will come to understand how the bodies of Law meet {computationally}.”**    

#####

We call these **"Three-Bees" Functions & Legal Objects "** _(**"Three-Bees"** stands for Beth, Bryan, Brenden- et al.)_ 

#####

_**The Functions are instrumental to shield the DAO from legal harm at a minimum via disclaimers- important!!**_

**Functions - Bryan:** (segment starting at 1hr 13mn & 40 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=4420 )
>Once we started identifying which functions produce which kind of outcomes, we can start coming up with a standard set of disclaimers that can be used for that series of functions. So if it's functions related to the voting mechanism or functions related to if it's the way the DAO meaning takes place, you can start coming up with templates that are specifically meant for DAO such that they're keeping the liability at a minimum. (Dazza: Amen- Beth: Definitely-).

**Legal Objects - Bryan:** (segment starting at 1hr 20mn & 20 seconds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=4820 )
>Just quickly I think the construction that we used in having all of these roles and functions and maps denoted by shapes and relationships is that what we are really moving into this Legal Object model where each different piece of the puzzle has different attributes that are based on not just where it's positioned but also the specific features that it holds and those features can help- those features will necessarily impact what the legal ramifications are in the event of any of these scenarios that we've gone through.
 
**Brenden:**
>I’ll throw something out there I think that's a great point Bryan and this came out in our pre meeting discussions and it is along the lines of what we discovered when we were talking about the bonding curve and how there are potentially different players with different roles and rights and obligations that you have along that curve so you and I think Beth mentioned in those discussions how it might start off being one set of right holders and then it moves on to more of a crowdfunding type of thing later on but the point here is that these things are dynamic and at some point a lot of complexity comes in due to that.

**Cem:**
>First call we discussed something like (reconstituted transcriptà) this were like a DAO enters into an agreement but then like somebody else joins the DAO and this agreement consequences is affecting this new employed person, and then we talked about the expectation from a new participant that he understands the condition of the DAO prior to his on-boarding.

**Silke:**
>Issues of liabilities of relationships are problematic when the system isn’t set up properly, in particular when things that weren’t considered before, happen, one has to revert to the mean of elementary relationship analysis frameworks of (Germany) Contract & Agency Law.

**Beth:**
>Yeah definitely well okay we can revisit that and you know keep iterating on this model and actually testing it in real, like to know more

**Dazza:**
>Thank you for your insight Silke the reason why we started doing this was to see if by just running through the fact patterns & different legal frameworks like agency then contract could we surface some insights and best practices that would be helpful as people are rolling out the data so I think every call we've had at least two or three to your point I think by Jove you've got it that's exactly what we're trying to do.

##### F-6: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 1- capped & to be tackled later: differences between jurisdictions 
 
“The point of all this okay is to begin to break the global legal system” (Brenden – all seem to agree). But, seriously, until we get there, as pointed out by Silke in several comments, the point is how to deal with jurisdiction specific differences, case in point operating out of Berlin.
 
The approach adopted at the onset for this project here, is to consider legal frameworks from the standpoint of US Law in the larger Common Law footprint, so that we could resolve some of the unknowable ambiguities in terms of what jurisdiction would it be, and just isolate what legal outcome would be at least in one set of circumstances (Dazza).
 
We understand that since our AALE/DAOs and their members are active across jurisdictions that may not be aligned on US / Common Law, we’ll have to sort it out at some point: in particular for the huge block of EU Civil Law countries, each country having its own specific set of laws, yet, even in a context of Euro-skepticism and rising nationalisms, there may still be disparate attempts at EU level harmonization.
 
However, the entire point at this initial stage is to trust we’re trying to find something that would cut across as many jurisdictions as possible (Beth). While Contract & Tort Laws may show great disparity across jurisdictions, at least with Agency Law it seemed like we could come up with abstraction without having to be too jurisdiction specific, since it is the kind of Law that works out similar primitives across jurisdictions.
 
Chris comment-1: we don’t have a problem with this approach, in fact au contraire we’d rather start with building a robust launchpad of Computational Law functions and frameworks from the ground up in the context of US (Common) Law rather than any other context- also because it may allow us to add later on further functions that take into account other crucial aspects such as Constitutional Law / Bill of Rights, Internet & Data Laws, Privacy Laws, Banking & Securities Laws, EAD “ethically aligned design- in context” functions if relevant, etc.
 
As we build up these and discover the “convergence of various bodies of Laws- computationally” (Brenden), we may start tackle progressively EU Civil Law bloc/countries, the diverse Indo-Pacific area, and the whole South Hemisphere. For now, cross-jurisdictions quandaries are best being tackled in context until you can sort out certain frameworks on what apply to whom where and how.
 
In our own business & industry experience of cross-jurisdictions issues, it is often a case by case approach, regardless of any frameworks, in situations of: private equity investment, trade (strong multinational groups vs small ventures branching out- Agency & Contract/Tort Laws looming large), FDI/special zones for economic development, alleged IP infringement, Labor Laws & Tax Laws arbitrage ; then cross-jurisdictions meaning between Indo-Pacific in particular North-East-Asia, US & Common Law countries, EU & Civil Law countries (in particular Germany, France & Belgium/Netherlands), and also Middle-East & Africa, plus some in South America.
 
The main challenge is to get lawyers to work together, with the international people (generally big US Law firms with global footprint and a strong Common Law culture) working across jurisdictions dealing with the domestic people (often non-Common Law Euro-Asian jurisdictions) who would reason mostly according to how things are run in their own pond- business as usual. Having experienced this over decades, we wonder how the Legal profession may react worldwide, as we increasingly bring our borderless alien stuff in their mix- it should be interesting.
 
Chris comment-2: when Silke made her rather relevant point about national differences in the way Agency Law may be structured and applied across jurisdictions, we couldn’t agree more: this seems particularly consequential for Estoppel in the context of Detrimental Reliance.
 
The concept of Estoppel simply doesn’t exist in Civil Law countries and, while the notions of “legitimate trust and/or expectation” by a Third Party vis-à-vis Principal/Agent aren’t foreign to the meta discourse of Civil Law, it looks like it carries little effective weight in litigation.
 
There is some work done in (European) Comparative Law that tackles these sorts of issues. In particular, French Law is quite reluctant (downright refractory) to use anything close to the notion of Estoppel in the context of Detrimental Reliance: French legal professionals and judges much prefer gauging the path of “intention / formalization / execution” by the deal initiators (Principal/Agent) than gauging the path of “perception” by the deal target (Third Party). Furthermore, anything related to the seemingly “nebulous” (at least for French) concept of “perception” doesn’t hold much water in French Contract Law at all- so it looks more like this cultural & legal difference with the Anglo Common Law might have some consequences: as rightly emphasized in Part 2 of the Berkeley reader (c/o MIT Media Lab Computational Law) on Restatement (Third) of the Law of Agency, there are like 7 (seven!) level of knowledges being identified by French judges, etc.
 
Maybe some implications on the notion of future record of intention with AALE/DAO and even duty of care / fiduciary duty, and definitely impacting the notion of liability depending and based on what parties (were supposed to) know. IF appropriate now & later on as part of our B/L/T/ methodology, we may dig (or rather excavate) this particular rabbit hole in due time and place, for ex. once we tackle Contract Law in the DAO mix and consider situations with members spread across jurisdictions including Civil Law countries / EU / France. Or elsewhere later if appropriate. This is only one aspect of “DAO members being spread across jurisdictions” anyway, and yet another incentive to find this common denominator to make it work in B/L/T mode across the world starting from a US-centered Common Law approach and them building upon it as we go. So that we don’t get bugged down in more guaranteed rabbit holes, or, if it must happen, that we have to excavate & explore them, at least it happens in a relatively cruise controlled way, until we indeed actually manage to break the whole legal global system, Amen.

##### F-7: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 2- capped & to be tackled later: code, free speech, and liability
 
On code, free speech and liability- while we capped it for now, this is definitely something that we want to revisit later and sort out: because these are pressing questions that may arise once we deploy our AALE/DAOs models and test them in the wild (conclusive statement- Beth).  
 
And so there is this, regardless of liability issues, “Code is Free Speech” (Jim). But that gets a bit mixed up with the similarities and boundaries between code & natural language. For ex., there has to be this distinction between the kind of code about which the author isn’t liable, vs this situation whereas someone wrote something, and then that person is now standing and becomes liable for the outcomes of that something (like this poem with coded state secrets). Now if someone has a recipe for building a bomb, what would be the difference for, if there was an inclusion of here's the code for how to build a bomb versus here's a natural language description of how to build a bomb? Why the fact that the actual code is able to be this autonomous force that doesn't have liability and liability doesn't go back to an entity therefore it probably wouldn't go back to an AALE/DAO? So there's this issue of first, why a choice of how much you would encode versus having it all in natural language where all logic flows for everyone (Beth).  
 
It becomes even more of a question once you notice that “code is code but code that's executed is something else” (Brenden) but then again the rest of us mere mortals would have thought of it as “code is executed as that is the point that it becomes code is law”. (Beth). So, what the heck.
 
Now it goes like this (Brenden - one of the most memorable moment of this Session with segment starting at minute 52 & 20 seconds when Jim states that "Code is Free Speech": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WhLz2AqmxY&feature=youtu.be&t=3140 ): you can have code in any kind of representation, in any language in assembly, however you want to represent the flow of logic. It could be even be in text it can be human readable, but just because you have code, if it is not executing in a machine right then, then it is just code sitting on your hard drive, which is not necessarily an evil thing. But if you have code that describes how to make and detonate a bomb and it's just sitting there and it's not executing, well how bad is it, maybe very bad. But if you have that same code, and it is executing, and it is doing the function right, well it's probably very bad. So, there's a difference between clearly things that are executable and things that are not even if their logic is (Brenden).
 
Furthermore (Cem) there are some basic using functions which are not operated by a creator of root code but are maybe even like days or multiple parties down the line that it becomes executed. Then it causes some sort of damage or something like that. The author is still the creator of that (chain of events with some damaging endgame), but “almost”, since for ex. the author doesn't host a server, he doesn't think it's just a smart contract that executes itself going through a configuration he set up (Cem). Issues of intention, chain of events and traceability loom large.

## Transcript of the 23rd July 2019 AALE Live Session from Berlin
## Directed by Beth McCarthy of the Mechanism Design Group

**Introduction - Dazza:** 
>And live ... hi everybody welcome to the third installment of this collaborative hack with **Brenden Maher** and with **Beth McCarthy of the Mechanism Design group** and also **Bryan Wilson** among others who've been we've been collaborating to organize this series you know playing deep dives against scenarios with automated legal entities and so this session is being hosted by the mechanism design group and being kind of convened by Beth and her team in Berlin so I just want to pass... My name is Dazza Greenwood I'm here at MIT Media Lab and we're holding down one of the stakes as a collaborator but this is the Mechanism Design show today so then I hand it off to Beth to sort of set it up and to help run the meeting so thanks Beth and then take it away.
 
**01:00 Beth:**
>So I guess if people have the HackMD open then we'll talk a little bit about the kind of methodology we're gonna use so in the past two calls then you know we started with this idea of there being applying agent principle law as a framework for examining kind of power differentials in relationships and who has fiduciary duty you don't want another in different situations when rights and responsibilities flow between entities etc so we could extrapolate those ideas to creating frameworks for DAOs so last time as everyone remembers we took our example of engaging with a physical book being shared between parties to a DAO use case where we walked through the DAO is agent is possible and now we all ready to take those step further in two ways number one walk walking through a book use case where a DAO was acting as agent principal and third party and specifically with a real life now example that Jim has made his so he'll tell a little bit about that. Maybe just start out but quickly about the workflow going to do so if you look on the HackMD then there's this publishing diagram that can be viewed as the certain functions that flow between entities that are marked in a circle and like autonomous processes that are marked in the square so what we're going to do is walk through each of those DAO functions through the lens of how you know the function presents is a transaction that is actually performed by the DAO and that is filling in this matrix that kind of maps on to it and this will start to make some more sense as we're going through it using the thought pattern narrative we made with different you know permutations for what can happen the same as we've been doing so we'll use this agency transaction table to which you know kind of repeat riffing off what Chris has shared with this idea of using a matrix as a way to go through and do these different permutations so we'll fill out for that you know who is the agent the principal and the third party and you know how does different configurations impact the outcome and we will use that then to look at this agency outcomes map that we made that is at the very bottom here that is a way of saying this is how in these different kind of like legacy system archetypes that we have in America like incorporating Company BBLLC and LLC in a general partnership how this analysis would play out differently based on the different perimeters that set those apart from one another because we talked a little bit last time about two different types of DAO archetypes you know a DAO hub or the DAO archetype which is this kind of nebulous network of participants that is minimally self-regulating and is was not trying to be in a configuration that matched an American legacy system and your type of DAO which is officially architected as a BBLLC in subject to these particular parameters and then I think what will start to emerge by the end of today is another additional DAO architecture that we can kind of use in this analysis which is this now that is coming together to perform a specific function for external parties and also for itself.
 
**04:57 Cem:**
>I think to get started if you want to like taking and see how can we centralize such functions like being able to invest fixed asset and enjoying the fruits of this asset and in fact public as with sales and with proposals and I tried this model just trying to capture how those functions can be done and centralized matter and I think it can serve us like if you run through this like law of agency lends to this diagram then you can actually see how complex the situation can get because the rules becoming very granular and complicated but I think it's a good starting point to just see where are the bottlenecks where we can condense things into the existing legal framework or where there is need for new perspective looking at these decentralized organizations occupying like functional roles into the real economy and yeah one other thing is that like every little function here can be customized to like a plethora of combinations and they can usually have like situation changing consequences as like models will change would like make something compliant or non-compliant or create a conflict or avoid a conflict by it that's just to say that like things like extremely complex.
 
**07:00 Bryan:**
>We came with these Law school patterns, so these bottlenecks converged exist because (inaudible). So we came up with this sort of DAO-lice and Bob example and so I'll just read through and once we get through that they've got instructions kind of like how we can see certain processes how we can start to understand more of the nuance and really break down and understand what the different rules are here. So we have had an aspiring poet of the Revolution named Bob who is seeking to print a limited-edition collection of some original poems for donors poetry answers festivals. Bob requests that DAO the publishing now produced 25 physical copies of the book to distribute before the festival begins on August 31st this proposal by a deposit standard for caching from DAO so that it is able to repel spam attacks. In June DAO receives buyers proposal to publish the book reception of the request starts DAO is procedure for the book publication which comprises a panel of curators who are eligible many eligible members review the proposal and whether the approval of the proposal should go through a lens basis where you know making sure that this is a book publisher shall actually wants to publish one of the core business functions and so the book is either approved or rejected by the curators of the DAO if the book is approved it moves to the next step if it's rejected the deposits claimed by the DAO doesn't recoup any of it and so this and then the next step being the espresso book machine which is kind of like the automated way to produce these books will print the correct number of copies of the book and then logistic partners like Charlie Corp are hired to ship the book and distribute the copies to the appropriate recipients and so jumping ahead of the table like the first spec item that we have is this one where nothing goes wrong so Bob submits manuscript of the entirely original work devoid of any illegal content or activity on the transaction execute as expected in the espresso book machine prints the completed versions of Bob's book in their requested amount without any IP violations the logistic partners then deliver the book on time and so for this one we backed it out a little bit at the top of the transaction table where we have this is limitation a the number of the public funds that third party introduced a book and in this case the member would be or the principal would be the member of the public the agent would be in DAO and the third party would be the publishing house. And so in this case you know everything actually works the way that it was intended and so we don't run into issues in permutation mean things start to get a little crazy though Bob includes a poem that when read backwards contains classified information about national security regulations none of the see none of the curators realize the secret information is included and so in this case we wanted to see you know like because this is functioning as a DAO like how are we going to start describing liability and so I'll open it up there for some discussion and then we can start filling in the blanks based on based on how the discussions flow.
 
**11:58 Beth:**
>Does anyone have any thoughts?
 
**12:03 Dazza:** 
>So let me see I guess just make sure I've got it on so in permutation beat so the parties are, let's see the logistics partner, how many parties are there and what are their roles would start with that.
 
**12:29 Bryan:**
>So if you look at the publishing DAO workflow diagram open agent that's the still enlisted then we have all of the different roles identified with the circles and then we have all the automated processes indicated with the rectangles and then we kind of have the you're able to visually see the flow from one part rather like how this kind of transaction was taking place over these different throughout these different permutations.
 
**13:09 Jim:**
>So I have a question about the I can imagine well enough like what's the legal form of like the logistic partners or people in public or officers but to me these long clear with the espresso book machine legal status is it owned by a company is itself?
 
**13:30 Cem:**
>It’s (Expresso Book Machine) is actually designed to be owned by DAO, not sure about the legal system, it is purchased and tokenized, etc. (inaudible) via STO.
 
**14;27 Jim:**
>Yes yeah but nobody's suddenly focus of the like three buying machines and that salesmen there's not like three minutes of the cheese just buying a machine the dollar buys it from the legal entity that happens before maybe it buys it from the website (Silke comments).
 
**15:16 Dazza:**
>Okay so just to kind of go with what you said so far of looking at the work the diagram for the publishing now it seems like for the scenario A and the permutation and B there's member of the public okay so the publishing DAO at some point there should be an arrow for the publishing DAO pointing to the author requisitioning basically no okay well who starts the sequence like somebody asks that there'd be a book published for Bob and then somebody approves it and then somebody basically tasks um the logistics to create the book so can you just run through that pattern so we can see your because the arrows don't reflect that right now.
 
**16:11 Brenden:**
>The question is what is the order what's the starting point.
 
**16:17 Bryan:**
>So from the starting point like so from the background beneath the publishing diagram we have our starting point is Bob who's seeking to print the collection of poems so
 
**16:30 Dazza:**
>What circle does Bob belong to?
 
**16:33 Bryan:**
>He's a member of the public okay and so from member of the public he submits the proposal the proposal like he has to state a certain amount of funds in order to prevent the publishing proposals accepted or rejected funds are either deposited and they are transferred to the EB espresso book machine as like a down payment on like the production run that he has.
 
**17:13 Dazza:**
>So just to double-check Bob is in the member of the public circle?
 
**17:16 Bryan:**
Yeah also an author but he's not in the author circle the author circle on the right is little bit different these are for the members of the publishing DAO multi political leaders
 
**17:35 Cem:**
>There can be another scenario in which like Bob is an author that got on board too though and then he's proposing to lead out from inside without
 
**17:49 Beth:**
>There's a major distinction that we just tried to do the simplest version of it which is somebody can join the DAO themselves and publish from within the DAO but that is one of the factors that would change it because then the DAO become a principal because somebody would come with them the DAO would be doing it so in order to keep the agent as a third party that is getting published through then Bob like does not he stays as a member of the public he doesn't become an author that exists within the DAO
 
**18:17 Jim:**
>But I would say that actually people who did propose and then the author editor trader are people who were ready proposals in the past and maybe to give them a token yeah they're part of the guild or the co-operative if you could set in advance saying like every time you become an offer you get 200 tokens or the people who are making this book or whatever the role is. (Cem, Silke (garbled, un-transcribed) on business montage).
 
**19:23 Jim:**
>Like it becoming an agency never though so it doesn't confer personhood there necessarily.
 
**19:30 Beth:**
>And so what I meant was agent in the definition of like whether it's an agent versus the principal because we're going through the matrix with the agent and when I mean by agent is Bob it like they're producing something on behalf of you on both sites that is possible but just not for the constraints of the narrative yeah so just right now and yes otherwise it was I mean that into the in different parts of the scenario than parts of that might change around but like for the sake of this Bob is not part of the DAO he is not operating from within the DAO he's an external force that the DAO is operating by proxy for him.
 
**20:18 Dazza:**
>Bob is the principal basically in the author he said kind of basically submits to the DAO I'm saying hey we like I want to publish through your DAO the DAO approves it and then basically hires the logistics partner to do the publishing and distribution is that the basics of it?
 
**20:35 Cem:**
>We could go into more decentralized model, where there is a bounty, the bounty hunter becomes 3rd party, etc.
 
**20:55 Dazza:**
>Yes but I mean just for purposes of working through on one scenario is what I just said what we're working through or do we want to do the bounty thing
 
**21:11 Cem:**
>Just a little bit there again like you can know it's resilience robust you can tweak scenarios
 
**21:22 Dazza:**
>For legal analysis, you can't ever really know a legal outcome unless you apply the lots of facts so we kind of have to at least lock down some example for the analysis
 
**21:32 Beth:**
>Hopefully we laid that out in that narrative…
 
**21:36 Dazza:**
>Okay so then so what happens in permutation B is it turns out there's something illegal in the book and the book is basically like contraband because it's a state secret and violates some kind of security law is that the idea?
 
**21:50 Beth:**
>Yes quite um yes so basically there Bob who is not part of the DAO, Bob is the principal
 
**22:06 Jim:**
Why Bob is the principal which were working for the DAO I mean maybe he is
 
**22:11 Cen:**
>What is it what is the justification that Bob is the principal
 
**22:20 Jim:**
>Now the DAO was paying him one of his books like
 
**22:27 Bryan:**
>He wants to run up these books who speaks to be published and so in order to have those he asks the DAO which then hires a logistics company to deliver the books
 
**22:37 Jim:**
>Like a process where he proposed I'm gonna make a book in the know
 
**22:42 Beth:**
>So to run back through the fact pattern kind of basically you know Bob is this poet there's people who donated to his like Poetry Festival he wants to print 25 books to distribute to the donors of the festival as like you know I think you gift and also to like promote his poetry he chooses instead of another small press option to have this book be printed by the expresso book machine so the Dow is just performing at the function for him of like printing and like shipping his book so I guess that's kind of where we're at so like you know in permutation a then he submits entirely original poems that have nothing illegal in them it's not pirated
 
**23:26 Jim:**
>So what is the proposal process about? What do the members of the DAO vote on?
 
**23:32 Beth:**
>So I think the members vote on is whether or not his proposal will pass which his proposal is like to get his manuscript printed
 
**23:40 Jim:**
>Is it a proposal or is it a commission, does that change the nature of the relationship?
 
**23:45 Cem:**
>This DAO is like eligible for printing content, maybe they're an architecture journal has nothing exact I'm allocating funds to know like
 
**23:59 Beth:**
>So we basically left just to be very clear we left off the fund allocation part to keep it simple so has the funds from somewhere else like he's providing all the funds and just paying the DAO the function the DAO is doing is using the expresso book machine to print the thing for him so creating yeah then they just like yeah
 
**24:31 Cem/Jim:**
>Yeah then they just like yeah and then it becomes not the principal may be commissioned by the DAO to write a book oh yeah if he was commissioned
 
**24:39 Beth:**
>And another thing another situation that could happen is he could make a proposal for the DAO to help him with  the fundraising process, in this case he has the money to print this book from somewhere else it's from the donors so external people gave him money he's using that external money, he made in order to stake into having this that happen at all he like made a deposit but then in order for the book once the vote once they go to approve that they're going to print his book then he has to pay the entire rest of the money that he has they're not using the fund like the market manager thing
 
**25:25 Brenden:**
>I had a question so because it's not printing names who is the person to Silke’s right
 
**25:51 Cem:**
>Great great to see you
 
**25:59 Brenden:**
>And so this statement I think to give clarity is and to answer the question is Bob is the principle because Bob initiates the transaction with the agent which is DAO which is the DAO that's my understanding
 
**26:17 Dazza**
>Sort of initiate but the key thing in agency law is that the principal and the agents agree with each other that the agent will do something on the principal's behalf as basically is like the servant of the principal for this task. Yes that's a little bit of a stretch for the intended so glad that we're able to suspend disbelief that this is usually probably not how it would go with the DAO but at least so we can run on training wheels first and then build the complexity up
 
**26:52 Beth:**
>Up definitely because there's some really like it can get really crazy so quickly that it's it would be hard to have a structured discussion where you went through each of the things so you know this is just the most of all situation though you think
 
**27:05 Dazza:**
>Think so so what so we're so the question that you can ask at the end of these is what would what are the rights and responsibilities of the party when the thing blows up so it represents the fact that when the thing blew up you get a cease and desist letter from the National Security Agency earth or you know the equivalent agency of your country where most of the people are where Bob is or where the machine is that's polluting or whatever, and okay now what happens make it clear that there that in this country under this law they have a fine and they assess a fine of a million dollars for this violation, and now people are wondering like okay I wanna, now we get into sort of like almost a quasi litigation or a mediation context and people are trying to throw the hot potato to the other party saying what I don't want to pay it should be the expresso machine or I don’t want to pay that should be someone else, uses of each party in terms of ultimate liability for this massive screw-up
 
**28:12 Jim:**
>I would argue that it's up to the it's about where the machine is located because if the machine is printing say in Germany where it's all subject to that regulation that there won't be a problem but if it's printing the machine in the US then it is contravening the law and it's not the people in the DAO who might be in Mongolia or in Indonesia or somewhere to be responsible to what the EBM is doing in America right perhaps so it's a circle
 
**28:38 Dazza:**
>Perhaps so it's a circle that says logistics partner they're the ones that operate and basically own the machine or no?
 
**28:57 Silke/Bryan:**
>The DAO owns the machine in this example the function basically that has subsidized through whatever means the logistics partners are or more so the people who once the book is I'm saying once the book is printed and there's like the 25 books are the logistics partner is the one responsible for getting the books from the espresso book machine to to Bob who requested the copies
 
**29:29 Dazza:**
>So distribution okay so then so the question would be if in order to have a circle from a legal perspective unlike a technical diagram like in this case the circle represents a party and a party is a legal entity that can sue and be sued like that's the whole point of it so according to all over good enough analysis if there's nothing else that's happened such as creating an LLC or some other legal form that would hold up then the default analysis is you have a general partnership so every member of that circle would be jointly and severally liable for the actions that happened so they're the ones that own the espresso machine and just to go with what Cem was saying that's the jurisdiction where the heats coming down from the Security Agency and they just assess the fine then what I mean I'm not a litigator but I would imagine that people would start wondering is there anybody that's a member of this DAO who has like locus or nexus with that jurisdiction like do they have a house there do they look there can we get our hands on them and you can start basically subpoenaing those people because they're all jointly and severally liable are there any other assets at all but then to kick it up a notch so if you imagine that it has legal personality which is kind of the idea of the legal entity part of the AALE then you ask the question well what legal personality does it have is it a corporation an LLC and nonprofit up some other form and then you could ask why do you think it is this legal entity like is there a jurisdiction that's granted it or is there some other reason why a court would ascribe legal entity-ness to it so how about those questions
 
**31:19 Bryan:**
>Sure so I think we get to you know the point that you were just at with like really drilling down on the like type of entity that's involved the type of issue that's involved and these specific outcomes that are correlated with that point in kind of this agency outcome scenario tracker and that's where we wanted to and this is kind of like where we were building to but I think it makes sense so I jump a little bit ahead so that it helps provide look like the depth of context there but for each of these different entity types it's foreseeable you know that we can start plugging in some of the work that Chris has thrown into the matrices or what happens with the automated autonomous legal entities we can start building that into kind of this framework where we look at it on Google under that general partnership under the lens of an LLC under the lens of a BB LLC under the lens incorporation and look at the not only the analysis for if it's just like a this traditional situation but also the analysis if it's a DAO that's involved and start comparing and contrasting and understanding what those patterns are between like what happens if it's a DAO what happens if it's like a human or a set of human who just kind of done this without any kind of technological assistance it's just the kind of paper paradigm there and so I think by walking through the transaction table the agency transaction table and identified these people identifying what happens when things go wrong and identify what those roles and responsibilities are we can then start going through the agency outcomes sheet and populating it with the relevant information that we extract it
 
**33:22 Dazza:**
>Do you want to if it’s not too disruptive do you want to quickly run through permutations and B and just see what would the outcome be
 
**33:34 Bryan:**
>Sure I'm gonna share my screen it has the interactive version I've included the PDF there I can upload the xmind file itself once it's too …
 
**33:45 Dazza:**
>So just a quick note on the diagram that you that is on my guest bed screen the binding is sent part I think kind of speaks to you is there an agency relationship like was there that agreement that is enforceable that some principal and some agent agreed hey I'll be the agent for you and do this thing so that's kind of what's caught up in that okay oh you've got it so I'm gonna go mute.
 
**34:43 Bryan:**
>Which permutation where we going through? B- okay so the curator is to view the content pass and vote on the approval proposal or they pass if the vote passes and they improve the proposal sorry and then when read backwards the it contains the classified in for me so the questions are like what happens when this goes wrong and like which roles are responsible and I think in this example there would probably be some duty of the publishing DAO since it's meant to like kind of curate like the content that's coming through there ensure that nothing bad is happening that they would have some duty to not publish information if the you know the NSA or that resource coming out for them with the information that they have yes it would affect the ability for them to like reach you so if even if it was like it was somewhere that was incorporated
 
**36:17 Beth:**
>We can also impact the knowledge because it's like none of the curators realized that this is included is it something where they're they would have more duty of care to that if it's in their country people go for it
 
**36:30 Jim:**
>I would go more for like a permutation see we're like Dave or D I don't know it is where they know it's illegal you have to take into account that we're talking about publishing here so let's say WikiLeaks would like commissioned them to print you know Hillary Clinton's emails that say yeah or you know the war files in Iraq it would be illegal even talking about the US like it would be illegal for WikiLeaks to get that information but a newspaper even like a centralized entity has the right to make that information publicly available and that was the whole question about the Daniel Ellsberg Pentagon Papers and the legality of freedom of information I think we should also take into account not just principal agent law but also freedom of information within publishing yeah
 
**37:17 Dazza:**
>Okay so so where this is a little ambiguous and that makes tripping me up a little bit to think about a legal analysis is you've got general partnership up top and then you have principal third party agent but the kind of the relevant aspect of the scenario in order to run a legal analysis is which of the parties is a DAO so you're gonna say that and then and then what is the general partnership so it seems like in the in this particular scenario just to lock it down you've got a principal who is a single human being named Bob you have an agent that is a DAO that is a general partnership and you've got a and I don't see who the third party is definitely.
 
**38:08 Silke: (garbled but picked up by Beth next:)...
 
**38:41 Beth:**
>Well okay so based on that I'm wondering if we should move to permutations you are we do specify more details (Dazza: okay) does the thing cuz I'm kind of talking about a combination of those because for permutation B the thing we're trying to get out this idea that if there's a legal information somehow in a book but the people who are approving the existence of this book don't realize it's illegal or in general that's like the DAO is publishing this illegal thing then I mean you could be it's a photo book of child porn or something like that though the point of that is twofold: number one the dirt what is it legal in all the possible jurisdictions as we were talking about and then also not to get too hung up on those details I mean so to talk about permutation C and then I think it could be really used to talk about is there a difference with is with whether the content is illegal and an intellectual property way versus like violating a regulation so for permutation see as it turns out several of the poems in the book are verbatim copies of films by Allen Ginsberg they're part of the Ginsberg estate and unavailable through the public domain ie the points are pirated because we had to figure out how a physical book would be pirated none of the curators who voted to approve the proposal realize that the poems weren't all original in fact most of them didn't review the content of the book at all most of them no votes I mean sorry one of the no votes did come from a curator he noticed that the poems were very similar to Ginsberg and looked up the original poem to confirm it but didn't share that information with the other voters so you know to compare between permutation B and C then in both scenarios there was some an illegal aspect the proposal passed regardless that all the curators who voted yes to pass the approval were ignorant as to whether I can ignorant to the fact that they were illegal but you know here hopefully so I don't know if that kind of shed some light on what we were thinking of useful to go through C and then revisit B in relation to it or
 
**41:21 Dazza:**
>Okay so it seems in essence in it it's sort of the same thing where there's something illegal or liability attracting about the content of the book but in this case it's IP and not violation of some state secret right (Beth: yes) okay um so one thing that's interesting that I'm just kind of spit balling here but the reason why agency law is so interesting as opposed to contract law tort or something for looking these relationships is when you've got an agent that's operating on behalf of a principle and that's the and that is like a valid relationship the principle is at least wonder US law it's Silke and others please type in if it's different there's a standard that says the principal is held to know everything that the agent notes and so there's like a constructive knowledge so if the agents of where or something the principle is held to be aware of that thing too so the agents acting like as the principle which means that the agent damn well better tell the principal things that they become aware of like the property you're buying is on toxic waste or whatever they know the principle is held to know that so if in this case the agent is the publishing is the doubt and the principle is Bob and for whatever reason Bob is unaware that it stuff is violates IP but the eighth one of the people at the edge one of the agents is aware it may rep as a question of whether they've dragged Bob down because of the specific facts it seems quite likely that since Bob was the originator of the material that Bob I guess in the ordinary course I'd assume Bob would be well aware of what Bob did though the question then becomes can you'd like attribute the knowledge of this one agent to the other agents you know somehow like did they become tainted with the knowledge that there was a violation somehow without IP it's really complicated I usually stay away from it--be but there's other issues with contributory like violation of IP where you know just the mere fact that you're doing it even without knowledge you can create some liability and like there's a whole tangled web of IP law that I think we don't need to we need to not get into in order to just look at the general liability flirt between parties start at a high level when something goes wrong but those are some just super high level you brings on permutation feet
 
**43:55 Beth:**
>Yeah well one question about that and maybe this is what you were hitting on is we included a this thing of like you know the curators didn't know that they were contributing like the curators who voted to pass it at all didn't realize that they were doing that and the one person that didn't realize this like wasn't involved in like pushing it like the actual transaction itself that like kind of pushed the causal chain forward so the what I was kind of trying to get up there and like something that we had talked about and wanted to try to touch only the fact pattern is like the extent to which the corporate veil like it happens with DAOs and like in particular like whether the different people and the DAO are all considered on equal footing as entities within the DAO or if only voting members since you know going back to the diagram where you know there's autonomous processes and then there's the human in the loop that happens if so it's basically like the process is only pushed forward by the actions they're capable or voting and so if the action that happens such that the book is actually published is only pushed forward by individuals that didn't realize that they were doing something wrong then does the opinion or the level of knowledge is someone who didn't know they were doing something wrong like this that have any impact like liability piercing
 
**45:37 Brenden:**
>Yeah that’s a good point right yeah

**Dazza:**
>what did you say Silke … how so like what I ... would it be different from one to another (**Silke:** garbled)

**Brenden:**
>Can you say that again and speak closer to the mic Silke

**Dazza:** 
>Yeah we couldn't really hear you …
 
_**(our (Chris) off-record comment:**_
>At this stage Silke made a point about _**national differences in the way Agency Law may be structured and applied.**_ Due to garbled audio, what Silke said he’s hardly audible and didn’t appear in transcript, but this to us sounds like a reasonably relevant point for ex. with _Estoppel in the context of Detrimental Reliance._ The concept of _**Estoppel simply doesn’t exist in Civil Law countries**_ and, while the notions of “legitimate trust and/or expectation” by a Third Party vis-à-vis Principal/Agent aren’t foreign to the meta discourse of Civil Law, it looks like it carries little effective weight in litigation. There is some work done in (European) Comparative Law that tackles these sorts of issues. In particular, French Law is quite reluctant (downright refractory) to use anything close to the notion of Estoppel in the context of Detrimental Reliance: French legal professionals and judges much prefer gauging the path of “intention / formalization / execution” by the deal initiators (Principal/Agent) than gauging the path of “perception” by the deal target (Third Party). Furthermore, anything related to the seemingly “nebulous” (at least for French) concept of “perception” doesn’t hold much water in French Contract Law at all- so it looks like this cultural & legal difference with the Anglo Common Law might have some consequences:as rightly emphasized in Part 2 of the Berkeley reader (c/o MIT Media Lab Computational Law) on Restatement (Third) of the Law of Agency, there are like 7 (seven!) level of knowledges being identified by French judges, etc. Maybe some implications on the notion of future record of intention with AALE/DAO and even duty of care / fiduciary duty, and definitely impacting the notion of liability depending and based on what parties (were supposed to) know. IF appropriate now & later on as part of our B/L/T/ methodology, we may dig this particular point in due time and place, for ex. once we tackle Contract Law in the DAO mix and consider situations with members spread across jurisdictions including Civil Law countries / EU / France). This is only _**one aspect of “DAO members being spread across jurisdictions”**_ anyway, and yet another incentive to find this common denominator to make it work in B/L/T mode across the world starting from a US-centered Common Law approach and them building upon it as we go. So that we don’t get bugged down in more legal booby traps or rabbit holes, or, if it must happens that we have to explore them, at least it happens in a relatively cruise controlled way, until we indeed actually manage to break the whole legal global system, amen.)
 
**46:45 Dazza:**
>I may be way off base here but I thought most the basic principles of agency law we're identical across you know
 
**Silke:** still garbled - further develops on above point.
 
**47:50 Beth:**
>Okay the entire point of this is to trust like we are trying to find something that would like cut across as many jurisdictions as possible because you know with contracts all with all the ways that we've been thinking about cuz then it depends where like to frequent you know torques etc but then with agency law from our understanding then it was hopefully something that could be looked at is like an abstraction to a certain extent without having to start a jurisdiction to the same extent like obviously that's always like one of the originals like one of the primitives that you have to start with but huh
 
**48:33 Dazza:**
>We had a sort of a conceit for the first two sessions Silke we would choose we looked at what we call the Restatement of agent the Restatement of agency third which is very much the United States kind of legal qualification which I think is largely similar but we actually did lock it down basically in US Law so that we could resolve some of the unknowable ambiguities in terms of what jurisdiction would it be and just isolate what legal outcome would be at least in one set of circumstances but since this meeting is being hosted in Berlin I feel like we can't really do that like that would be really wrong huh
 
**49:15 Silke:** still garbled - further develops on above point with roles & relationships between different jurisdictions, picked up next by Beth.
 
**49:36 Beth:**
>And at least for this example Allen Ginsberg stay is in the United States so it probably if they're being sued or whatever by Allen Ginsberg estate and the permutations so at least so yeah sorry about the US central way of you know okay
 
**50:01 Brenden:**
>That's the point of all this the point of all this okay is to begin to break the global legal system right yes (all laughing – agree!)
 
**50:20 Jim:**
>What about things somebody ought to remind on the Roman principle like the horse that is owned by nobody but a story like that oh like what happens when the horse that's not you don't know the owner for the forks until someone
 
**50:42 Beth:**
>Yes thinking back to my prior life in ancient Rome it was 3,000 years ago but I mean I think so that goes to another thing that we had talked about a lot and then decide it was probably a rabbit hole that we didn't want to go too far down but the fact that there's this distinction between code being more about this I think I learned about it from you I call it the fact that code is why this course the author of it isn't liable unlike you know writing than the person who wrote something it's come on you're standing you’re now liable for the outcomes of something so for ex. of something in the original configuration for this poem that contains information about a spy agency we have been thinking about if it was contained I have a recipe for building a bomb, what would be the difference for if there was an inclusion of here's the code for how to build a bomb versus here's a natural language description of how to build a bomb why the fact that the actual code is able to be this autonomous force that doesn't have liability and liability doesn't go back to an entity therefore it probably wouldn't go back to a DAO so there's this issue of why number one a choice of how much you would encode versus having in language because nobody would flow differently so I don't know if the horse ex. is analogous to what we're saying
 
**52:20 Jim:**
>I don’t know about the liability right but well I think the right is “code is free speech”
 
**52:38 Brenden:**
>This is a very interesting very interesting thought because you know code is code but code that's executed is something else
 
**52:50 Beth:**
>Is it waha just getting here so I always thought of it as code is executed as that is the point that it becomes code is law I mean but maybe yes
 
**53:11 Dazza:**
>Could you extrapolate on that Brenden what are you talking about
 
**53:15 Brenden:**
>Well you know I can have code in any kind of representation right in any language in assembly however you want to represent the flow of logic right I mean it could be even be in text it can be human readable right but you know just because you have code if it is not executing in a machine right then then it just code sitting on my hard drive is not necessarily an evil thing but if I have code you know that describes how to make you know detonate a bomb and it's just sitting there and it's not executing well you know how bad is it it may be very bad but if I if you have that same code and it is executing and it is doing the function right well then it's probably very bad so there's a difference between clearly things that are executable and things that are not even if their logic is
 
**54:25 Cem:**
>And then there are some basic using functions which are not operated by a creator of root code but are maybe even like days or multiple parties down the line that it becomes executed then it causes some sort of damage or something like that I'm still the creator of that has almost like he doesn't host a server he doesn't think it's just a smart contract that executes itself going through a configuration he set up
 
**54:59 Silke:**
>Yes
 
**55:07 Beth:**
>Okay so you know because okay so I think I might like cap this rabbit hole because I do you want to try to finish as close to that or as possible and I think we're like halfway through the use cases so but definitely interested in revisiting that in the chat and in general because I really think in terms of what which things are like actually pressing questions for issues that will arise when hopefully it's become something we're testing in the wild then that's gonna be a major one so or there's or we could go deeper into discussing that thread and take discussion to the from permutations like D through F to a future time are just asynchronously so which over another do
 
**55:58 Dazza:**
>More use cases
 
**53:00 Beth:**
>Okay so from me to and then also just how we have been should we go through the agency outcomes map which is you know the thing that Brian was showing at the very bottom that you know it's very fun but it's also like guaranteed rabbit hole so there's you know the question of a feast you do that or we should continue through that or if we should go just save any discussion for that for the very end so I think you know if y'all I love talking about it and it's also the beginning of this diagram the framework that we hope to start introducing but moving ahead to permutation E only talking about this agency transaction grid here and not yet referring to the agency outcome that so permutation II you know the request has been approved to print the book or no sorry the request has been right Bob has made his proposal request to get the book printed and you know the DAO curators are deliberating for too long about whether they should print the book like you know he made the request and like the book needs to be printed by August 31st he made the request you know right now like there would have been enough time if it was instantly approved but like you know some of them think that the content sucks so they don't want it to be like affiliated with their co-branding (Silke: garbled) (Beth continues:) yeah I mean that's I think that's and we intentionally left that open in case any of this change so the only facts that we have are the gal curators take so long and reviewing the book that by the time the deliberation is happening it won't be printed in time for the delivery they're in time for the festival and should I forgot that I'm not on screen sharing one second (Beth sharing screen) um so to go back to how this permutation did plugs in here in terms of the authorized DAO functions this is the DAO function of what logistics done curators review proposal logistics company ships and also onboarding because the smoke aunt was mentioning then what Bob is actually interactional agreeing to would be covered in onboarding so it's kind of there's this question of what who knows what so to make sure that we refer back to this chart maybe if you wanted to walk us through how this one would play out with the flow chart --- that's right so it's permutation D sorry um oh I accidentally skipped one but this is nice we can we can go back to D that's what I said huh right I accidentally skipped D so we'll do it after but we're just doing it right now
 
**59:45 Jim:**
>So I mean since like DAO like the contract is signed between the agents once the DAO approve the proposal etc.
 
**60:10 Beth:**
So it's his problem that they didn't enter into the agreement and it's a failure point that doesn't have legal implication unless it's built into the contract so we've wanted to include this one because that's where contract law intersects with agency law and hundreds need to be corrected in the situation
 
**60:34 Dazza:**
>So in permutation D (in fact talking about E) the principal is Bob still? Who's the principal who's the agent and who's the third party in D (in fact talking about E)
 
**60:53 Beth:**
>or in okay well and then when we just talked about which is E
 
**Dazza:**
>yes think E excuse me in the book when there's a failure with the delivery because it took too long who's the principal who's the agent who is a third party s
 
**61:13 Beth:**
>So Bob is the principal, the DAO is the agent
 
**61:15 Jim:**
>So I would say the Principal-Agent relationship it's not good because it has not been formed
 
**61:30 Dazza:**
>So the Principal-Agent relationship has not been formed okay well then we can't do a agency law analysis if there's not one of those but why don't we well how about just a contract law analysis
 
**61:41 Brenden:**
>Why hasn't it been formed I didn't get that
 
**Cem:**
>That because I mean from my non legal perspective, if a DAO did not vote on such proposal it just means that they don't enter into an agreement in the first place so like they can be let's say that since the attention is limited there can be 100,000 proposals and just because they made the proposals that mean that without is the agent for those principles so it's only the principal when the DAO approves entering agency relationship then they should have some sort of liability in executing the principal proposal
 
**62:48 Beth:**
>Okay awesome thank you does anyone have any more thoughts about E before you move that back to D
 
**62:55 Dazza:**
>I don't see that there's any basis for liability at all unless they've out promised that it would decide by a certain time or something or like if they breach some promise or duty
 
**63:10 Beth:**
>So you know with that in mind what would if we were constructing this DAO in real life what would be some important factors to make sure we consider so that we don't run into that problem
 
**63:25 Dazza:**
>Well one thing to make it clear to everybody before they submit a proposal that you know we may say yes no or take no action on your proposal and we bear no liability and then honestly I mean think you might as a DAO also want to make clear you might want to make a click-through sometimes that the people that submit a proposal agree contractually to your terms and then one of the terms honestly should be we are not your agent for purposes of the stranger absolutely eliminates an agency law analysis
 
**63:58 Beth:**
>Totally (Silke: okay) nice okay well that has been confirmed by Silke as a valid behavioral approach so moving back up to D
 
**64:15 Dazza:**
>So Cem this is not legal advice but talk to a lawyer and think about getting that stuff in there so that's something useful for you comes out of the session
 
**64:27 Beth:**
>I’m useful discussion definitely talk to you yeah lawyers in their official capacity okay so permutation did the functions involved are number four the logistics company shows so it's this part at the very bottom where the expresso book machine has printed and logistics partner billet the approval has passed so that the action can start happening of expresso book machine printing now logistics partner Charlie corpus the logistics partner so it needs to show so when we have their the publication is initiated meaning curators have voted to approve the proposal and the order was sent to the logistics partner Charlie Corp to ship by August 31st Charlie Corp in turn accidentally selects the shipping date at the end of September instead of August - calendar app thing - going shipment long past the date Bob was promised so the debt on the DAO's and then everything was done right like the voting the learning happened it was that's the expresso what machine and we've passed down the supply chain to a six partner but then on the logistics partner and then it messed up so the thing that I was trying to get out here is the logistics partner is a third party but insofar as the logistics partner is part of it if this inextricable part of the process of actually delivering the contract of getting the book out by this particular date then is the logistics company kind of also an agent of the DAO one away like the logistics partner I would think would have a duty to deliver correctly like this book that was ordered through them so does that mean that because the DAO like contracts with the logistics partner to perform this function then because the performance of the function fell apart on the logistics partner side then you know is the DAO still liable for the fact that they were supposed to deliver on that time even though it wasn't the actions within the DAO but instead a contractor of the DAO might have messed up.
 
**67:03 Jim:**
>You're always saying that that was the point I was kind of make to you guys in the box which is it depends on what is the big old interfacing yeah so did they sign a contract that stipulates that it's appliable in a certain jurisdiction is it referring to like a decentralized arbitration scheme is it a system where people are completely taking and there's an escrow and then they only move after so it really depends on again like the notion of jurisdiction um
 
**67:37 Dazza:**
>So if you if you sort of say that you know if you kind of fuzz some of that detail and try to apply an agency law analysis if you said the principle was the DAO and the agent was the logistics company that messed up and the third party was whomever like well the funny thing is I guess the third party you could say was the like the reading public or you'd have to think about who the third party was but have to be someone that was waiting for the book and who is harmed by the fact that it wasn't there so you know I don't know the bookstores or the adoring fans or whatever then then probably like in the highest level of drive you can attribute the paths of the agent to the principal and so if the doubt thought it was such a great idea to choose this logistics company that was their choice they were in the best position to avoid the loss and there can be held responsible under agency law from the acts of the agent in fact that's the whole point of agency law is to draw a direct connection between the principal and the agent and to drop in to figure out the lines that they're offering with them and then if you certain thing about defenses you can wonder you know like was there's some supervening kind of cause was outside of a contract term or maybe like was doing something but you didn't say this in the facts but like if the agent was way out of the scope of its authority and there's no point an ordinary reasonable third party would have known that then you know they break the liability chain but for the most part I think the basic analysis is the principal would be held responsible for the negligence of the logistics agent in not providing the service.
 
**69:49 Silke:** (garbled – making a point on DAO’s ability to sue logistic company etc.)
 
**70:22 Dazza:**
>Exactly and just to play it through even more realistically so that we have all these are connected the you've got a third party that's aggrieved in this case so like we were depending on the book but our birthday party didn't work because we didn't have the books or we lost some money in our business they sue the principal the DAO let's say for not giving me the book and then the DAO does a cross-claim or something like that or counterclaim or a cross claim to their agent who was the publishing company to say hey it was your fault so I just got sued for ten million dollars you owe me ten million dollars to pay off the suit because you're the one that messed up and you know and so it kind of I think that's how the chain goes but to really complete these things in the scenario you have to be a little more explicit about what went wrong who was harmed and who can they lay their hands on basically
 
**71:23 Beth:**
>I mean Charlie was wronged because like they are harmed not wronged oh yeah yeah definitely it's like even though you know his book is terrible so maybe everyone else was better off that it didn't get distributed so you know the only actually also the intern was probably because they made like a terrible error there in derivative in every way
 
**72:09 Brenden:**
>Yeah Dazza to go back to your circular point (Dazza moves hands circularly on screen, Beth laughs, that is a true LIVE session) if the publisher if principal had a clause that said I I'm not going to be liable for your unhappy child at his birthday party then there wouldn't be an issue right
 
**72:32 Dazza:**
>Yeah if you can get a direct mention of the liability as the parties sometimes do it and in the contract clauses, once we finish this agency law stuff we should probably spend some deep time on contract law where most of the action is but there's a ways to then wheedle around disclaimers and things like that but like that is a very important and interesting analysis and it kind of gets I think the DAO stuff to the place where it needs to get to which is thinking through like what should be the standard clauses and who are the people that should be agreeing what and when in the whole lifecycle of the transactions so I think yours as usual you're ahead of your time Brenden a hub hood like I think you're asking exactly the right question for tomorrow which is you know what kind of disclaimers can you put in there what other liability what kind of damages taps and what is the chain of contractual privity basically that makes sense for the innovation and the new relationships made possible by the DAO.
 
**73:40 Bryan:**
>Once we started identifying which functions produce which kind of outcomes we can start coming up with a standard set of disclaimers that can be used for that series of functions so if it's functions related to the voting mechanism or functions related to if it's the way the DAO meaning takes place you can start coming up with templates that are specifically meant for DAO such that they're keeping the liability at a minimum
 
**74:21 Dazza:**
>Amen
 
**74:21 Beth:**
>Definitely- okay so let's move to the final permutation if everyone is down which is F so this is just one that is very trivial compared to the other but I wanted to make sure that we got all the authorized DAO functions or not all of them because though we left off the ones about fundraising because that's an entirely different discussion that I think we’ll probably get into securities and we maybe in the future we can go there but (Beth sharing screen) in terms of the authorized dial functions that you know we're covering here then we also wanted to say where does something go wrong with onboarding new participants so here we have when Bob submitted his proposal and deposit the DAO's onboarding manager informed him that he would have to pay the full amount before shipping & printing could start information also clearly stated in the proposal contract that like the smart contract that had to be to activate the printing and shipping to start so if you remember there's this proposal contract and the proposal has passed and we said we're just like for the sake of us when the in order for the perfect to go from proposal passing to actually being printed by the expresso book machine then he has to pay the full amount so there's enough funds for the expresso book machine to run this is where fundraising one would come in if we were going there but he so he understood the stipulation when he was signing and then he was waiting for more donors to come through before paying the full amount so basically he wanted to start the process and know that the publisher that he could use to publish his book is the expresso book machine because you have been trying to figure out what publisher to use and so he knew that that had been passed but then since in order for the process to actually begin on printing then he would need to be able to pay the full amount he thought he would be able to get more donors to actually pay for it then you know by mid-August he accepts that like no one else is interested in funding it so he has to choose between cancelling the order which would cause him to lose the deposit or just funding you know the 25 books himself but by that point of mid-august the event is on okay yeah the event is on August 31st so it's like he had sorry oh wait I there's something um yeah so basically he has to choose between just not getting the book printed at all but unlike before where it was the fault of the logistics partner not printing it in time now it's his fault because he was on-boarded to know that he had to do all of these steps in order to actually get it printed so I guess this comes into a point where now like and I think this also probably just highlights the fact that it's impossible to really get into an analysis of this without contract well because it's like he tries to say that because he wasn't all warned enough you know then they should cover the cost so like to try to get at this question of like who covers the cost for these different things that make sense so yeah
 
**78:07 Silke:(garbled)**
>Is this also a question of general terms?
 
**78:40 Beth:**
>I mean there's also question like was an agency relationship worked at all is it like the other that earlier fact pattern where there wasn't actually any agency relationship because … I don't know I was asking huh
 
**78:55 Dazza:**
>It seems more like a tort kind of contract thing the way that you did it
 
**79:02 Beth:**
>And maybe there's some other examples of how onboarding could go wrong as well so that's probably not even a good permutation maybe but the thing just before we quickly close up this it's open to any questions that anyone has about this then I think what I really wanted to highlight there is how each as we mentioned at the beginning each of the circles is human behavior that exists to a certain extent off chain whereas each of the square parts is an autonomous software going forward and that is like the bonding curve that maybe we can talk just briefly mentioned for a few minutes oh it's not like the spot box but like the fact that each of these different functions it is involved in initiating or impacting a transaction and some of them like onboarding might come in its certain points and end up impacting other points
 
**80:19 Bryan:**
>Just quickly I think the construction that we used in having all of these roles and functions and maps denoted by shapes and relationships is that what we are really moving into this legal object model where each different piece of the puzzle has different attributes that are based on not just where it's positioned but also the specific features that it holds and those features can help are those features will necessarily impact what the legal ramifications are in the event that any of these scenarios that we've gone through
 
**81:02 Brenden:**
>I’ll throw something out there I think that's a great point Bryan and this came out in our pre meeting discussions and it is along the lines of what we discovered when we were talking about the bonding curve and how there are potentially different players with different roles and rights and obligations that you have along that curve so you and I think Beth mentioned in those discussions how it might start off being one sets a set of right holders and then it moves on to more of a crowdfunding type of thing later on but the point here is that these things are dynamic and at some point a lot of complexity comes in due to that
 
**81:54 Cem:**
>First call we discussed something like (reconstituted transcriptà) this were like a DAO enters into an agreement but then like somebody else join the DAO and this agreement consequences is affecting this new employed person, and then we talked about the expectation from a new participant that he understands the condition of the DAO prior to his on-boarding
 
**82:47 Silke:**
>Issues of liabilities of relationships are problematic when the system isn’t set up properly, in particular when things that weren’t considered before happen, one has to revert to the mean of the elementary relationship analysis frameworks that are (Germany) Contract and Agency Law.
 
**83:35 Beth:**
>Yeah definitely well okay we can revisit that and you know keep iterating on this model and actually testing it in real so definitely would like to know more about
 
**83:47 Dazza:**
>Thank you for your insight Silke the reason why we started doing this was to see if by just running through the fact patterns and different legal frameworks like agency then contract could we surface some insights and best practices that would be helpful as people are rolling out the data so I think every call we've had at least two or three to your point I think I think by Jove you've got it that's exactly what we're trying to do
 
**84:16 Brenden:**
>Great well this was wonderful awesome
 
**84:18 Bryan:**
>Thanks everybody for being on
 
**84:20 Silke:**
>Could we do it on earlier time NY time?
 
**84:23 Beth:**
>Yeah because it's always midnight express
 
**84:41 Dazza:**
>From now on that we should say it'll be like this timeslot like the twelve noon time slot for the it for all these things because if we can keep our European partners this thing's going to be much better
 
**84:56 Beth:**
>Definitely well thank you so much for joining us at lunchtime and hopefully was a great discussion it was really fun planning it and hearing else in sight so great
 
**85:09 Brenden:**
>Thanks a lot-
