* Page 1 **Marked text: AALE is a great threat if/when no human controllers.**

> "This Article argues that algorithmic entities--legal entities that have no human controllers--greatly exacerbate the threat of artificial intelligence"

* Page 1: **Marked text: Reasons why AALE with no human controller are a threat**

> "Algorithmic entities are likely to prosper first and most in criminal, terrorist, and other anti-social activities because that is where they have their greatest comparative advantage over human-controlled entities. Control of legal entities will contribute to the threat algorithms pose by providing them with identities. Those identities will enable them to conceal their algorithmic natures while they participate in commerce, accumulate wealth, and carry out anti-social activities."

* Page 3: **Marked Text: Four aspects of corporate law that make AALEs a threat**

> "Four aspects of corporate law make the human race vulnerable to the threat of algorithmic entities. First, algorithms can lawfully have exclusive control of not just American LLC's but also a large majority of the entity forms in most countries."

> "Second, entities can change regulatory regimes quickly and easily through migration."

> "Third, governments--particularly in the United States--lack the ability to determine who controls the entities they charter and so cannot determine which have non-human controllers." 

> "Lastly, corporate charter competition, combined with ease of entity migration, makes it virtually impossible for any government to regulate algorithmic control of entities."

### WIKIPEDIA LEGAL PERSON

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person

 >the doctrine of *persona ficta* allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty
 
>as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of delict due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities. This effectively moved such liability to persons acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since persons were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of negligence and able to be excommunicated.
